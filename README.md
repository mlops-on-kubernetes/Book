## About This Book

Machine learning is no longer a research projectâ€“it's infrastructure. It's operations. It's pipelines, training, and inference. From recommending what to watch next to flagging fraudulent transactions, ML systems have become core components of modern software. But while building a model in a notebook is straightforward, scaling and deploying that model reliably in production is where most teams fail. According to Gartner, up to 85% of ML projects never reach their intended impact. Why? Because the hardest part isn't the model, it's everything around it.

Operationalizing machine learning means taking a promising prototype and integrating it into a system that can scale, recover from failure, adapt to new data, and stay performant over time. This transition demands much more than good models; it requires disciplined engineering across infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, and data pipelines. This is where MLOps comes in. MLOps is the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and DevOps, a set of practices and tools that help teams build, deploy, and maintain ML systems at scale. And today, the most versatile platform for building MLOps infrastructure is Kubernetes.

This book teaches you how to design and operate scalable ML systems using Kubernetes. You'll learn the tools, patterns, and architectural principles needed to move machine learning beyond experimentation and into production safely, reliably, and repeatably. Whether you're building an internal platform or scaling an AI product, Kubernetes gives you the foundation to operationalize machine learning like software.
